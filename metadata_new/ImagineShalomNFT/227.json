  "description": "Imagine Salaam/Shalom (\"Peace\" in Arabic/Hebrew a 'la Yoko Ono's \"Imagine Peace\") is a Charity NFT Collection that draws on the unique perspective of the Live Encyclopedia: Large Nature Model. In 500 unique digital pieces, the project hallucinates imagined possibilities when two male soldiers, one Israeli and one Palestinian, are disarmed, stripped of their uniforms, and subsequently transported to a utopian shared space. Removed from their locals of Gaza, Tel Aviv, or Jerusalem, the men become reacquainted in an underwater biblical Garden of Eden falling into the depth of the Mediterranean Sea. Their human, sensual, and intimate lives are revealed and showcased with a generative AI model dedicated to the natural world. As witnesses, we are invited to Imagine Peace and Wage Hope.\n\nBenefits two non-profit organizations: Parents Circle Families Forum (PCFF) and Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF).",
